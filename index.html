              <p><h4>End to end ML application</h2>
                In this project, we have developed a Flask application 
				that performs object detection using TensorFlow 2 (TF2) 
				object detection models. The application's user interface 
				is designed using HTML and CSS files, providing a simple 
				and interactive experience. The TF2 models are served on 
				TF2 serving for efficient deployment and management, and 
				the entire project is containerized using Docker for easy 
				scalability.

              <h2>Custom Object Detection</h2>
              <p>
                The project aims to leverage the power of transfer learning by utilizing 
				the TensorFlow 2 Object Detection API and the TensorFlow 2 Model Zoo models 
				to accurately predict four different types of birds. By building upon 
				existing pre-trained models and fine-tuning them with bird-specific data, 
				the project seeks to achieve high accuracy and efficiency in bird classification, 
				which can have numerous applications in fields such as ecology, conservation, 
				and wildlife management.

              <p>
				The project utilizes the Sounds8K dataset to train a machine learning model capable 
				of classifying 10 different classes of environmental sounds. The trained model has 
				practical applications, including enhancing emergency services' responsiveness and 
				enabling sophisticated threat analysis by security agencies. The model can detect 
				criminal and anti-social behavior in real-time, contributing to safer communities.
